This article nails it. Fritz has no sense of humour, and that's why Germany will always lose at war.  @JohnnyChilcot: In the year 2037 @A_LordDarling I wouldn't want to be inside a black hole for six minutes, frankly. Quantum uncertainty. @WingsScotland And what are the numbers for non-male MSPs? @bencooper @WingsScotland Bit prescriptive to impose such a label on anyone. Not everyone fits into neat non-male / non-non-male dichotomy. @WingsScotland Beaten by the Scottish Christian Party, too. I'm sure there's a joke about rising from the dead somewhere in there. @WingsScotland Never underestimate Christ's Lordship. @WingsScotland One of Scottish Labour's many intractable problems is that they ever attracted these pricks in the first place. @hsigreens @DaftLimmy On the contrary, that was a photoshopped image. He's also denied being anti-semitic. #BothVotesMalcolmMalcolmTwice @hsigreens @DaftLimmy That's the politics of fear talking. Vote for what you believe in. #BothVotesMalcolmMalcolm @DaftLimmy Gerry Adams' prolapsed arsehole on the cover of a top shelf magazine. There's a reason to visit the corner shop. @WingsScotland @alexmassie The "people would vote for bad things" argument is incredibly misanthropic: People=shit -&gt; democracy = dangerous.  @ThomasPride: At the very best, this is an example of out-of-touch BBC hacks in a Westminster bubble. At worst? @moh_kohn @WingsScotland A crude attempt to associate Nicola with Wings. The original tells another story... @JohnnyDundee @WingsScotland @WingsScotland Conservative first principles: Strong &gt; bad &gt; weak.Ruth Davidson Loyalists = strong, Lab &amp; Lib Dems = weak, SNP = bad. @scottreid1980 "Yes, but we're sorry we hate the Jews. We now accept that Hitler was bad." @WingsScotland Yep - the reasons may be superficial ("He drinks beer like me!") but people just want someone who they feel represents them. @DaftLimmy "Hitler had the right idea." Something like that, apparently. @WingsScotland Maybe this question can be answered by posing another: why has our society produced so many willfully infantile morons? @TripeUK Do you mean for TMB to appear for searches relating to tripe, or for "tripe" to appear in relation to searches for "edible food"? @TripeUK An old family friend once bought a sheep's head from the butcher's for 10p and kept it for a week in the fridge. He never married. @scottreid1980 @NicolaSturgeon Still having to suffer Eurovision in an independent Scotland would be a DependyRef trigger, sorry. @TophuFil @TripeUK Enough of the soft stuff. Give us something a bit more hardcore...  @DaftLimmy: Mixed emotions as everybody tries to link to a Prince video on YouTube, then remembers that the cunt took them all off.  @clean4thequeen: So glad they managed to get this Paris underpass #CleanForTheQueen in time for Ma'am's birthday!  @SenSanders: I didn't hear folks in Congress calling wealth redistribution "radical" as $1 trillion got transferred from the middle clasâ€¦ @hrtbps @WingsScotland I couldn't stop tugging vigorously on my forelock, but then the Queen helped finish me off. #rockofstrength @A_LordDarling On the contrary: what you have just witnessed is Plan nuremBerg. As in "Nuremberg Rally." As in the Nazis, frankly. Jobs. @pete_sinclair I can't help but feel that this is only moving the problem somewhere else.
