If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we‚Äôd have no jobs in America‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt have a clue. In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election! Isn‚Äôt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump &amp; gets nothing done in Senate? Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media‚Äîasking for increase! Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn‚Äôt care less about the American worker‚Ä¶does nothing to help! Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman‚Äôs card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet ‚Äúwhen a woman stands up to you‚Ä¶‚Äù If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose! Thanks Piers. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016  @dmartosko: 'Duck Dynasty' star Phil Robertson says he'll back Trump for president via @MailOnline Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn‚Äôt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold. Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing! I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come! Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite! . #RepMikeKelly  Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. Thank you for the nice words! Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current! I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people! If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did! Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat‚Äîshe had one! #NEPrimary #VoteTrump #Trump2016#WVPrimary #VoteTrump #Trump2016"@Valdosta_Monkey: @ChrisCuomo @realDonaldTrump  Is Chris serious, lying or misinformed?

I started watching your show due to Donald Trump. Will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBizAlert  at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy! "@RichBooth6: @realDonaldTrump @CNN good interview Mr. Trump. You set the facts straight." Thank you. Wow, I hear @Morning_Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.They misrepresent my positions!

I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me! On @seanhannity show @FoxNews now. ENJOY! Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border. Bad! .@KellyannePolls  Kellyanne, you were fantastic on @meetthepress today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning.

The politicians can't. @realDonaldTrump will give his all for us! .@EdGoeas thank you for your support tonight on @JudgeJeanine. Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor! I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you. I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S., and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters Join me in Washington today!Spokane tickets:Lynden tickets:Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name? Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts. Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. Let‚Äôs properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs records to see if she is Native American. I say she‚Äôs a fraud! I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both. Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win. Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight! Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad! Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters! "@Ausbiz:  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain" So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen." Thank you Rick! Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016 Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&amp;coal companies out of business." She then apologized.

I will be interviewed by @BretBaier @SpecialReport at 6pm ET tonight @FoxNews Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas. Totally untrue!

I will be interviewed on @TODAYshow and Good Morning America at 7:00 A.M. I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:15 A.M. Enjoy! I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him! .@oreillyfactor  Please correct, I WON Virginia! Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget! Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time &amp; money Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!#INPrimary #VoteTrump Polls close at 6pm! #INPrimary #Trump2016 #VoteTrump
