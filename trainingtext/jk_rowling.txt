I'm so tired of losing the Keith Vaz game. @twlldun @RobertCorp @HelenMilburn @kevverage I've just lost again. @twlldun @RobertCorp @HelenMilburn @kevverage Indeed. Winning at the Keith Vaz game is merely the temporary absence of loss. @RobertCorp @HelenMilburn @kevverage Don't go meta on us, Rob. That's a surefire way to ensure heavy losses in the Keith Vaz game. @HelenMilburn @kevverage Worst day I've ever had playing the Keith Vaz game. I fear relegation. @HelenMilburn you're dragging me down with you. @HelenMilburn @danieljksn @BrianSpanner1 @chrisdeerin @YokoOnoGlasgow Great, Helen. By reminding me of my loss, you've made me lose again. @danieljksn @HelenMilburn @BrianSpanner1 @chrisdeerin @YokoOnoGlasgow Suffice it to say you've just made us all lose. Look what this woman did. Tess Asplund, you are magnificent ❤️@trewloy @chrisdeerin I was winning the Keith Vaz game until I saw you respond to that Keith Vaz game-related question. The idea that anybody believes this is strangely upsetting to me.  @kenny_murray: When will folk drop this rhetoric? Scotland isn't a house elf waiting on a sock.

Duh. I think you've got your referendums mixed up. Your values could use some work, too. @HelenMilburn I might start keeping a tally of how won over I feel. Today: 4%. @spmargaret Thank you x The big push to win over No voters seems to have started early. The best tribute he could have. Arthur lived, so Lupin had to die. I'm sorry. I didn't enjoy doing it. The only time my editor ever saw me cry was over the fate of Teddy. 😢 In the interests of total honesty I'd also like to confess that I didn't decide to kill Lupin until I wrote Order if the Phoenix. Once again, it's the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts so, as promised, I shall apologise for a death.

Xxx The term 'junior doctor' refers to grades leading up to consultant. Some have worked in NHS for more than 15 years.  @IndyVoices: After six months as a junior doctor, I've handed in my notice. I'm too demoralised to carry on Every doctor I know fears making a mistake above all else. This contract spreads the same resources more thinly.
