Looking forward to this. I'm also speaking on a panel in the afternoon, but don't let that put you off... :-) #pac16 "after two pigs secretly had sex behind his back"I don't think they actually did it *secretly*, @JamieRoss7. @LabourHame: New on @LabourHame:@f00tballreferee says Scottish Labour’s problem isn’t policy, it's more fundamental: it’s trust. @tristanrryan @Plaid_Cymru Again, something you didn't say before. Fair enough though. @tristanrryan @Plaid_Cymru Where did you say that before sorry? @tristanrryan @dalkeithfiddler @Plaid_Cymru You were literally just saying it didn't look terrible when PC did it! You remarkable hypocrite. That's Daniel Johnson MSP sworn in at Holyrood. :-) A proud day for @EdSoCLP and his whole campaign team.  @LabourHame: New on @LabourHame:@DanJarvisMP marks 22 years since John Smith's death &amp; says the party must remember his message. @tristanrryan They didn't just vote against Labour, they voted for @Plaid_Cymru. Apparently approached by PC on Monday. @tristanrryan Surely @Plaid_Cymru voters didn't vote for them to do dirty deals with UKIP? Whatever you think of Labour, seriously, UKIP? John Smith died this day 22 years ago. @KatePotts11 Damn right. @RayMcG69 @drooperscot I often think so. Or in less sartorially challenging terms - why are we so bad at defending our record? @RayMcG69 @drooperscot No, our approach was about where powers best sit. Your guys backed FFA and wanted to ditch Barnett. Madness. Thought-provoking stuff from @BioMickWatson. Convincing, too. @RayMcG69 @drooperscot Evidently not. That's nothing to do with the Scotland Bill! That's a partisan representation of Smith positions. @drooperscot @RayMcG69 The context was someone pretending that 200 MPs outvoting 50 is the same as different parties uniting against SNP. @drooperscot @RayMcG69 What an odd thing to say in response to a plain fact. @RayMcG69 @drooperscot Nope. You really didn't pay attention to Scotland Bill did you. You just believed what people told you. @drooperscot @RayMcG69 No, I was stating the plain fact that Labour has four times as many MPs as the SNP. What's your problem? @RayMcG69 @drooperscot Scottish Labour has never claimed not to be part of UK Labour! What utter rubbish you speak. @drooperscot @RayMcG69 In Westminster we are part of a 200 strong team. That *is* the point. @RayMcG69 @drooperscot How is that a sham? @drooperscot @RayMcG69 Like Scotland has its own parl't but is part of UK, Scottish Labour has its own leadership but is part of UK Labour. @ohFUCK_OFF @KevinPMeagher Are you going to pretend that's the same thing, or will you astonish me by apologising and accepting it isn't? @ohFUCK_OFF @KevinPMeagher So by "what Scottish Labour think of Duncan" you actually meant "what unhappy ex Labour voters think of Duncan"? @Kennyf1283 @mrjamesmack :-) *You're* not the clown... @ohFUCK_OFF @KevinPMeagher Who do you think the people who post negative comments on Labour Hame about me are? @mrjamesmack @Kennyf1283 This clown is not representative of UK Labour. In any meaning of the word. @RayMcG69 Eh? We have four times as many MPs at Westminster than the nationalists. That's not blocking, that's out-voting. @ohFUCK_OFF @KevinPMeagher I don't believe Scottish Labour posted a comment. Who do you think these folk are exactly? @NiclasReddish @KevinPMeagher @LabourUncut I think his lack of reply certainly suggests that. @bgilmour @Kennyf1283 Ah, I now realise what you meant... Not had coffee yet... @bgilmour @Kennyf1283 Oh I didn't write a piece, I just got ranty on Twitter! :-)  @DalgetySusan: This is why we need legal quotas - support @Women5050   @AlastairDalton: FirstGroup to run 5 low-fare trains a day Edinburgh-London from 2021. Extra Virgin services also approved but bid by 3r… In which Kenny manages to be far more reasonable than me. Good stuff.“A reply to Kevin Meagher” by @Kennyf1283  @JournoStephen: Power above all else is its primary concern because it is a nationalist party.  @JournoStephen: It will do whatever it takes because it is a nationalist party.  @JournoStephen: It will work with anyone to achieve this because it is a nationalist party.  @JournoStephen: Plaid Cymru wants to thwart a Labour government because it is a nationalist party.  @JournoStephen: Why are people so surprised at what is happening in Wales? @thoughtland @LabourUncut What's funny Pat? @KevinPMeagher @Chris72600702 @JamieGlackin1 @LabourUncut So, not satisfied with slagging off your own, you're now defending our opponents?  @youngvulgarian: [stands on chair][clears throat]Well what's happening in Wales...It's PC gone mad, innit.[hides behind chair][dod…  @chrisdeerin: Last push for today's piece @samdoespolitics @wru4me @Cat_Headley You're suggesting Neil Hamilton... wait, that's a fair point. @wru4me @samdoespolitics @Cat_Headley By getting Plaid to ask for UKIP support on Monday?  @JamieGlackin1: @KevinPMeagher @dhothersall @LabourUncut @IanMurrayMP Straight talking is fine. Contempt for Labour Party activists
