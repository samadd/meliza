 @Independent: Owen Jones nails why it's wrong to blame immigrants for the housing crisis  @ClaireSewell: Wise words from @OwenJones84 on the quiet crisis of #masculinity via @NewStatesman @bella__mela aww x @VividRicky thanks @jeeznotuagain cheers Dawn @DanJohnson111 thanks Dan @Jgs_x cheers John @CraigJones12 When I criticise the Remain campaign for scaremongering, I'm not attacking Remain voters. This argument is genuinely surreal. @CraigJones12 No, I accused the official Leave campaign of bigotry. Not voters. Why's this so hard to get? @Corporaticians where did I call UKIP racist @CraigJones12 attacking Labour policy is not attacking Labour voters. Attacking Tory policy is not attacking Tory voters. And so on. @CraigJones12 for the *millionth* time, criticising an organisation is not the same as attacking voters. Why is this so hard to get? @CraigJones12 no - what does Tony Benn have to do with the official Leave campaign exactly? @leninology it looks at how the LGBT and feminist movements have challenged an oppressive unreconstructed masculinity @leninology with respect, Richard, I don't write the headline, as you know. @EthanLDN I don't think I've argued Labour should no platform and refuse to debate Tories - I reserve that only for fascists and racists! @moethemyth thank you! @EthanLDN yes, we should have a politics based on hope that addresses problems, how's that contradictory? quite irritable, aren't you? @EthanLDN fine, you don't agree. that's politics. but I don't think it would do anything but repel Labour voters leaning towards Brexit. @LouPross cheers Louis @sIlv3rh4ze because it just wasn't relevant to any of the topics? @GregCroker ah cheers Greg @EthanLDN Senior Labour figures making common cause with Tories in campaigns based on fear damaged Labour in Scotland. That's all it is. @EthanLDN #headdesk As in "jointly campaign on the same platform", not "don't appear on topical news panel shows"! @GraemeWhiteside thanks Graeme @cfrasershanley thanks @khaleesi_leahxo aww @spank_squirt haha @nadnoll thank you @RobiMous2 thanks @bruceS13 thanks Bruce @xavinisms :) @mark__smith__ :) @ruinskiz aww cheers @realbritainros aww thank you hero! x @gemmiegem thank you Gemma! @angelenewright aww thank you @Stefanletting cheers Stefan @Cedarwood15 no worries @AndyM0rgan54 cheers Andy @Jules1965 very sweet of you @dharmabum013 or maybe - just maybe - it was completely and utterly irrelevant to any of the topics? @skiptheyouth :) @Mitt_Ruminant @VividRicky thanks @pompeydunc haha @starkinlondon @bbcquestiontime aww thank you @CraigJones12 Again, could you answer the question? Is attacking the Remain campaign for scaremongering attacking Remain voters? Yes or no? @CraigJones12 Eh? If you criticise the official Remain campaign, are you attacking Remain voters? A yes or no will do here.  @HuffPostUK: . @OwenJones84 says 'blaming' immigrants for housing crisis lets Tories off the hook. #BBCQT  @bbcquestiontime: .@OwenJones84 says blaming foreigners for the housing crisis lets government off the hook #bbcqt Right, on #BBCQT shortly. Wish me luck! @jameswjacobs @MissLilySummers eh? I'm not arguing for it to disappear at all @tomsperlinger under proportional representation? @Charliecondou hahah @SuperCoolEskimo @0ldtimer But that's not how it works - the audience decides the topics, not me @90percenters oh bore off - I've tried to raise this as best I can There's about 15 billion injustices on earth. I try to raise as many as I can but a) I'm only one person b) it's an EU referendum special! Blimey. Look, everyone, I will try to bring up alleged #toryelectionfraud on #bbcqt - but hard to just shoehorn in! @MadAlix14 I think the whole programme will be about the EU @TimMorton2 I didn't know - I'll get in touch with them @TimMorton2 am I chairing all male panels? Let me know if so and I'll get in touch with them @jeffnowill @BenjaminRamm @Another_Europe I didn't? I said the official Leave campaigns  @BenjaminRamm: WATCH: in under two minutes, @OwenJones84 outlines why the Left should campaign for Remain. #Vote… @gameoldgirl That's really not what the piece argues, I promise.  @NewStatesman: A first look at this week's magazine | How men got left behind @cdaargh f) I should say Walker's later comments were a direct response to me arguing the left should drop words like 'Zionist'  @SheffieldSU: As part of #VoteRemain there's a Vote In event with  @OwenJones84 @Christy_McM @natalieben @labourlewis @LouHaigh @cdaargh e) I was opposing the suspension of a Jewish black woman whose Jewish partner - and fighter v. anti-Semitism - I know very well @cdaargh d) my understanding was Jackie was directly referring to her own ancestors, and I would restate a) @cdaargh c) Graham Bash (Jackie's partner), who's Jewish and victim of anti-Semitism, is a long-standing friend who was very distressed @cdaargh b) though history is littered with other mass murders, Shoah is unique because it industrialised attempt to kill an entire people @cdaargh a) Jewish people were not behind the slave trade, and in no way would I ever endorse such a view @UKPoliticsLive @Fdy_Bin_Ysf no it doesn't. I mean they don't agree with the leadership but want to work with it @UKPoliticsLive eh? I'm referring to what an MP said - who I directly quoted! @cdaargh this is simply untrue. I blocked him years ago for incessant spamming about people I'd never even heard of @cdaargh I can't answer all tweets, Christine, but I totally agree, yes @BenMcKinlayMP If you read the piece, it's speculating about what would happen if we had proportional representation.  @MissEllieMae: Oh look I wrote a piece about Corbyn supporters booing Kuenssberg. Pretty sure it will piss off all involved @GazJayM might be worth reading what I actually think before attacking me @TVAddictStill @johnmcternan my understanding was she was talking about her own ancestors, but Jews were not responsible for the slave trade @TVAddictStill @johnmcternan I know her through her partner Graham Bash, who I've known for years: they are both Jewish @TVAddictStill @johnmcternan No, I don't agree with Jackie Walker's comments at all but I disagreed with her suspension. Is it time for proportional representation so both Labour and the Tories can split up? My new video!:  @electoralreform: "Britain has fragmented, and so has politics – but the electoral system makes us pretend otherwise" - @OwenJones84 htt… @Timbone_Returns thanks matey! @Erik_Boielle You know you're obsessively going on about something made up by a far-right troll? for a start I'm, er, gay @Fdy_Bin_Ysf @UKPoliticsLive and what does my piece have to do with a cult of personality around JC? @Fdy_Bin_Ysf @UKPoliticsLive right but I still don't understand the point of either of you. what is cultish about that piece? @mischawatson a pro-tip: if you don't welcome converts, then you'll never win people to your cause @mischawatson because I wanted to keep first past the post to prevent coalitions. I've just changed my mind. @Fdy_Bin_Ysf @UKPoliticsLive eh? supporting PR and approvingly quoting Labour MPs on the right makes me the peddler of a cult - what?! Uniting to divorce: why Labour left and right are backing PR to go their own separate ways - @mrneiltaylor it's completely different: I'm saying a split would happen under proportional representation. not possible under FPTP. @Dclell @MikeGapes well, they're completely different systems, but anyway. @Dclell @MikeGapes we have never had a referendum on PR. We had a referendum on AV (which I voted against, but times and attitudes change) @PhilJenkins86 eh? I did? I said Labour's left + right. Ask self-identified Labour right-wingers like @lukeakehurst (he's Old Labour Right) @MikeGapes indeed - as it says, only a minority Labour government at the very least could do it. @VLubev ah Denmark, that well known nightmarish basket case. @BruceMartin lovely stuff. @PhilJenkins86 it just means the right of a particular spectrum - it doesn't mean the right of politics generally @TheJamJarJamie I supported first past the post at the time because I didn't want permanent coalition government. Labour's left and right are trapped in the same party together. Could proportional representation set them free? Me: @SameiHuda because of the electoral system! It makes it impossible. That's the whole point of the article @PolProfSteve @not_DJW not it doesn't. It wasn't an unclear tweet. It was very clear - and a total misrepresentation @SameiHuda fine, but your initial argument about the SDP didn't make any sense @harryvann_ ah I'm really sorry - I'll make it up! :( @SameiHuda I really would just hope people bothered to read an article before commenting on it - seems odd to do otherwise @PolProfSteve eh? that's not what your tweet says at all? You said I argued Labour should split and the remnants should campaign for PR @SameiHuda I don't write the headline. I only write the piece. Why don't you give it a read?  @mrjamesmack: Labour and the Tories are both fractious coalitions. I think @OwenJones84 is right that PR would set them free.  @guardian: Why Labour may have to divide before they conquer | Owen Jones @PolProfSteve it is bizarre for an academic to either misunderstand or misrepresent like this. It says w split *after PR*. Not *before* @SameiHuda if you read the article, it's saying a split would happen if we have PR, not under this electoral system @PolProfSteve eh? I said such a split would only happen *after* PR! @mollyaismith ah so chuffed to hear that Molly! @cheesy_badgers thanks so much Laura thanks for coming! @BryOutlaw ah thank you matey! @pat_barklamb awesome to meet you! @MaxFoxJo aww I love you back @Sherif_Refat ah thank you Sherif! @JenSPSWer so chuffed to hear that! @benjaminpmoore ha @meganjones52 aww so chuffed to hear that, and thanks for coming! @catherinecaseyy Ah thank you and sorry I had to rush off - next time! @JristoE No. "IN a horrible state", as in "it is in a horrible situation". Completely different.  @jonsnowC4: A major development in the Conservative General Election expenses scandal @danielpostico can I DM please? @elespanolcom can I DM please?  @YousefMunayyer: Ex-Pres of Chad convicted of War Crimes but you have to get 23 of 27 graphs in to read this ht… @NickThornber @trishod64 I'll do my best 😀 @nutri_lad @MaxFoxJo whoop! @TheBoabie I'll do my best! @SJHemus !! @Purfleetjohn @textmaniacal @FoxHedgehog @johnmcternan You are trying to defend the indefensible @textmaniacal @FoxHedgehog @Purfleetjohn @johnmcternan anyone who reads that and disputes "thuggish demeanour". well, I can't even. @Purfleetjohn @FoxHedgehog @johnmcternan Nope. @johnmcternan A thuggish demeanour, I said. Here you go: And if you enjoy this witty and original tweet, then log on to twitter tomorrow because it's your lucky lucky night! @BioMickWatson @johnmcternan ah yes, I'm always slacking when it comes to criticising the Tories, me! @mmg8484 @HBrody7 nope: I'm really enjoying this referendum campaign it's been a real catalyst for thoughtful and nuanced debate! @ianlewis675 @bbcquestiontime haha! aww you! @johnmcternan If the NEC was investigating homophobia I would hope - and expect - at least one LGBT person to be represented on the NEC. @prings64 then that, my friend, is democracy! @tashfod aww! I'll look for you - give me a wave! x @NickHartley sorry Nick :( @charlotte2153 @johnmcternan his pedantry is centred on the fact she's not a candidate because she's been blocked from being one. Looking forward to arguing for a Britain and Europe run in the interests of the majority tomorrow on #bbcqt! 💪😀  @bbcquestiontime: Here's this week's #bbcqt line up in full: @LSRPlaid @trussliz @frankfieldteam @NeilUKIP @OwenJones84 @johnmcternan Not irate. I just think you are one of the most disingenuous people I have ever come across in politics. @johnmcternan a) the inquiry is dealing with several cases long predating Corbyn b) wow. Beyon shocking in your complacency. @christtocs @clementattlees as I've said, you're demonstrably a deeply unpleasant person and can you get off of my timeline? thanks! @johnmcternan and it is *madness* when rightly issue of anti-Semitism being dealt with by NEC to block the only Jewish NEC candidate! @johnmcternan oh good grief. one of the arguments used to block her was links to an organisation then falsely smeared with anti-Semitism! @christtocs @johnmcternan Unpleasant people. Like you. This isn't hard. Can you stop tweeting me now? Cheers. @johnmcternan don't even bother. Progress back only Jewish woman trying to stand, left-wing CLP blocks her. you'd say nothing? absolute joke @johnmcternan @adamwisdish95 @rheawolfson is that why there's an inquiry dealing with cases of anti-Semitism *under the previous leadership* @christtocs @johnmcternan genuinely - why are people like you so unpleasant? does it not bother you at all? and if not, why not? @christtocs @johnmcternan I'm saying having a Jewish voice on the NEC is crucial given the importance of tackling anti-Semitism. @johnmcternan all you offer is pedantry, petulance and a thuggish demeanour. you would be frothing if the boot was on the other foot. @christtocs @johnmcternan oh wow. I could spend the rest of my life debating unbelievably unpleasant people like you. But I won't. Go away. @adamwisdish95 @johnmcternan @rheawolfson indeed. no-one can deny how passionate I am about it. well, not in good faith anyway. @adamwisdish95 @johnmcternan @rheawolfson exactly. but we're attempting to debate the terminally disingenuous here.  @bbcquestiontime: First up on this week's #bbcqt panel, The Guardian's @OwenJones84 @johnmcternan c) if a young Jewish woman with your politics had been stopped by the Labour left, my word, your howls would be deafening. @johnmcternan b) the reasons given to stop a young Jewish woman standing included links to a group falsely smeared with anti-Semitism (!) @johnmcternan Because a) this was a very important in helping to undo the damage done by the likes of Ken Livingstone @christtocs @johnmcternan @rheawolfson Why are people like you so dishonest? I'm talking about the reasons *in the statement I retweeted* @johnmcternan @rheawolfson No, I didn't say that at all. I'm referring to Rhea's account of what happened. @kierancarter_ Read the piece - this isn't the leadership who did it. @Indy_Kimberley @rheawolfson Yes, I know, I retweeted Rhea's piece. Outrageous - the only Jewish candidate in Labour's NEC election blocked. The reasons why are beyond satire.  @Indy_Kimberley piece goes into that in detail! @ggohom afternoon Luis! @badlydrawnboyo I didn't write the headline. Read the piece when it's out / online. @t3rrywr1st Could you check your facts before yelling at people in future thanks What it is to be a man is changing rapidly - really glad to have worked on the New Statesman's cover story this week  @yorknouse: York Festival of Ideas: Owen Jones and Yvette Cooper are coming to York @landloulou @aandy1959 @IceQuee28159692 @CWoodie49 we're going round in circles here. I have never criticised Leave voters. @landloulou @aandy1959 @IceQuee28159692 @CWoodie49 I have nothing to do with the official Remain campaign. @landloulou @aandy1959 @IceQuee28159692 @CWoodie49 It is a straightforward lie to say that I've called you racist bigots. @landloulou @aandy1959 @IceQuee28159692 @CWoodie49 I've also opposed the scaremongering of Remain, so this is pointless. @aandy1959 @IceQuee28159692 @CWoodie49 @landloulou I have *never* said this. I criticised the official Leave campaign, *not* voters. @htwomey former Labour voters (now voting SNP) were antagonised by Labour politicians joining forces with the Conservative Party. @mikeysmith So when asked about sharing platforms with the Tories, the Labour leadership - inc Hilary Benn - must just say nothing? @mikeysmith I suppose your argument is Sadiq's decision (which he's entitled to) means leadership can no longer explain their position @mikeysmith he was just stating the leadership's explanation about why they weren't sharing a platform with Tories, in light of Scotland. @htwomey Sigh. No, he was expressing his view - in the light of Scotland - that sharing platforms in such a campaign would backfire. @Onemadegg @IanDunt He's a great guy and a brilliant writer, I'm just disagreeing on this. @IanDunt saying "here's my view about why the Labour leadership won't share platforms for strategic reasons" is not "I hate Sadiq Khan"! @IanDunt but saying he "hates Khan for sharing platform". He said nothing even *approaching* that. I'm just saying it because I was there! @htwomey @brief_rants @BBCNews I was there Hamza! He was just explaining why the Labour leadership weren't sharing platforms. @brief_rants @htwomey he was really just restating the leadership line: @miqdaad @IanDunt like going on a demo and going home and watching the news just showing disorder @miqdaad @IanDunt ah I give up. but it's instructive watching something you actually saw and seeing how it has been spun afterwards. @IanDunt he was just restating - when prompted - leadership's position on how a joint campaign could alienate Labour voters @IanDunt That's really not what he said. I was there! He was making general strategic point about wisdom of sharing platforms re: Scotland @mikeysmith I'm genuinely just saying his because I was there - it did not come across as an attack on Sadiq there @mikeysmith fine, but it was answering a question and he was just restating why he's not sharing platforms with Tories in this.
