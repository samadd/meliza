Evidently Ken Macintosh has won round at least one fan. @severincarrell That you declaring a preference? @RobbieDinwoodie @PeatWorrier Made a bad mistake going to see Bound in a kilt once. @S_U_A_R @Roy1Batty @SovereignAnnie Wait, there's other stuff to do at uni?  @Hayley_Barlow: Breaking: Electoral Commission taking Conservative Party to court for failure to disclose documents and information. #el… @S_U_A_R Years of personal abuse, actively sabotaging Yes campaigners he took a dislike to from within Yes Scotland. @thecommongreen @moh_kohn I believe the Scottish one is Holyrood's only secret ballot. @S_U_A_R I could go on. A lot. @S_U_A_R @kwr66 THE APOSTROPHE POLICE ARE NEVER OFF-DUTY. @kwr66 Alternative Scotland's what? @differentbreid @TheCommonSpace @thecommongreen That's traditionally what people do with money, yes.  @scottreid1980: Fish fish cardboard box, do the robot @karnag I like the URL. @HairyAngus Oh, I don't think there's much doubt about that one :D @allwasdark :D :D @HairyAngus Meant to pick it up on the way home but forgot. @HairyAngus Ooh! Thanks for reminding me - I saw it in another bargain shop on Sunday on the way to the train station. @differentbreid @TheCommonSpace @thecommongreen Um, it will, because they'll be paying less money. @differentbreid @TheCommonSpace @thecommongreen Propose something that actually does it and they always find something to complain about. @differentbreid @TheCommonSpace @thecommongreen It's a classic problem with the left. They love making the poor better off IN THEORY. @differentbreid @TheCommonSpace @thecommongreen The people who will get the money are ordinary holidaymakers.  @tartanhammer: @WingsScotland There's a queue. @OssiansDream Brannigans are jackets, though, and as such have those horribly crinkly papery bits round the edges. @Farseer_Del I do, but now I want to say that it's a replacement just to see that happen. @mikebell48 @METAKNlGHT Wee ginger pussycats are likeable.  @Wallid74: @WingsScotland yep. I've just checked capitalism's trousers. They've shat them. @DavieHay1 Really a lot. Well into five figures, probably nearer six. Bah. No Gordon Brown, but at least this afternoon's taken care of.  @METAKNlGHT: @WingsScotland Last but not least. @FiferJP Well, someone pictured it with a £1 Works sticker yesterday, so worth a look... My spies on the street tell me to expect flat-cut McCoys crisps any day now. REVOLUTION! *makes limp fist* @moh_kohn Your election leaflet's going to be a belter :) @BraidenHT Poor, poor Richey. Right, away into town. If The Works has the Brown book at £1 I'm going to try offering them 50p. @METAKNlGHT Now do him with the Black Panthers :D @TheCommonSpace @thecommongreen APD isn't paid by "the aviation industry".  @MrHarryCole: New: there will be no national exit poll for the referendum. @Ivan_McKee Congrats. It's lucky to have you :) @naebD You have to admit that'd be pretty funny. @scottreid1980 @JamieRoss7 *every day @SovereignAnnie I'm a lot more concerned by the fact that he's still a cunt now. @differentbreid Not a scooby.  @tiddlyompom: @WingsScotland he holding a butterfly hostage At least Tommy's fist looks like it might do some damage if he lamped you one with it. @DanLeePadgett Aye, thats him. Is that the Tommy Sheridan OathFist? Absolute state of Wee Trotsky McGurk there. @_delp_ Nine lost there but only six gained. Where did the others go? @MidasForTheGold @Phil_Football @BraidenHT @bpfootball Pretty impressive, then. @0apropos :D @severincarrell @ScottishLit @thecommongreen @ZaraKitson @thoughtland They may or may not prove anything. Still irrelevant. @DrMoragKerr Yep. The BBC were a lot quicker in responding to our follow-up complaint about Question Time in March: @Phil_Football @BraidenHT @bpfootball Is that current, ie after the demise of Rangers?  @Phil_Football: Blimey, a fascinating attendance league table from @bpfootball Scotland are top, England a lowly 7th @Conmaol @MissBabington Go on then. After the sartorial triumph of 2011, looks like Humza Yousaf got dressed in the dark this year :D @PeatWorrier Has anyone sworn allegiance to Queen yet? @RamAlbumClub Batten down the hatches! :D  @dmacl1983: @WingsScotland It's actually £2 as it comes with a DVD of Gazza's goal at Wembley... Final results of our reader poll yesterday. Quite tempted to stroll down to the Bath branch of The Works and see if they've got Gordon Brown's "Britain Ra Ra Ra!" Book for £1. @Conmaol @MissBabington There's no way of knowing that. All we have are the empirical facts. @kwr66 @SophiaPangloss @GKnollington That's about right... @PeatWorrier Me either, though I was only one letter out. @ScottishLit Feel free to prove it. But it's still totally irrelevant to the original point made. @SophiaPangloss @GKnollington I unfollowed a few weeks ago. It's just dishonest now. @ScottishLit What, a survey of every voter in Scotland? Tell you what, get back to me with your findings. Good luck. @ScottishLit It is a cold hard fact that list votes are, under the electoral system, for parties, not individuals. @Conmaol @MissBabington It's factually correct. They stood for personal election and failed. @severincarrell @DavidDavidsonXX @ScottishLit @thecommongreen @ZaraKitson @thoughtland Have you done a survey? He barely made it. @ScottishLit You're asserting an irrelevant unsourced opinion as a fact. Fine, but I'm all out of interest in this conversation. @ScottishLit @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland It's unprovable and irrelevant.  @andrewpicken1: The middle names of the new Tories adding at least ten minutes to this ceremony #SP16  @MissBabington: When you watch the msps firmly rejected by the voters get sworn back into the Scottish parliament it goes against the gr…  @scarlettparrish: Oh how quickly "Yippee; it's warm enough to open the windows!" turns into "GET THAT FUCKING WASP OUT OF MY BASTARDING…  @jamesmaxwell86: Donald Trump has now won a record number of votes - 10.9m - for a Republican primary candidate. The California primary… @ScottishLit @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland I'm saying what I've said. @ScottishLit @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland ...but are choosing not to. It's amusing. @ScottishLit @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland The inescapable fact is that the Greens can fix their gender balance. @ScottishLit @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland I'd love to see you show that. @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland That's why they get auto-replaced rather than having a by-election. @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland List vote is for party, not individuals. That's the system. @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland So only having 16% women IS a choice the party is making.  @STVColin: Tories and Labour swap sides in the new Scottish Parliament @pieandbov Not clear why we need to move at all. Not like the place is bursting at the seams most weeks. @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland Any two males stand down, will be auto-replaced by women. @thecommongreen @severincarrell @ZaraKitson @thoughtland You could fix it now if you chose to, though. Could be 50/50 Green MSPs tomorrow. @Jefforbited Needs work. @libby_brooks Did you ask the Greens why they didn't fix their gender balance? It's entirely within their power to do so right now. @SophiaPangloss @AngrySalmond Et tu, Angry? Dear me.  @GAPonsonby: The Queen has been captured by a Palace film crew telling Jeremy Corbyn 'You lot are fucked in Scotland'. Jackie Bird faint…  @alanferrier: @WingsScotland Happy Somerset Day.  @DAndersonI953: Can anyone remember when you were sent home for NOT having short back and sides? Bit of an uneven take-up of tickets in Stranraer tonight. @MhairiHunter @PeatWorrier I'm not clear on which of us should be more pleased/insulted. @MartynMcL The Naked And The Dad #RemoveALetterSpoilABook @MartynMcL Laughterhouse Five #RemoveALetterSpoilABook @MartynMcL The Hat Of The Day #RemoveALetterSpoilABook
